<!--
If we want to implement a pattern where we have both the toolbar at the top but then also a toggle side nav then we
will actually need to include the toolbar into the <mat-sidenav-container>.
-->
<!--
We can place <mat-toolbar> in any place and in any container we wish. The contents of the toolbar are distributed
internally by Angular Flexbox. It also has a color property.
-->
<mat-sidenav-container>
  <!--
  <mat-sidenav> is where we place our side nav. Ny default, it is hidden and needs to be toggled on the UI. To change
  this, we set opened property to true, like this: [opened]="openSidenav".
  -->
  <mat-sidenav #sidenav role="navigation">
    <p>I'm the sidenav!</p>
  </mat-sidenav>
  <!--
  <mat-sidenav-content> is where our main content goes that is placed next to the sidenav.
  -->
  <mat-sidenav-content>
    <!--
    If we want to have our side nav go over the toolbar, we have to place the tool bar inside <mat-sidenav-content>.
    -->
    <mat-toolbar color="primary">
      <div><button (click)="sidenav.toggle()">Toggle Sidenav</button></div>
      <div>LOGO</div>
      <div>
        <a routerLink="/signup">Signup</a>
        <a routerLink="/login">Login</a>
        <a routerLink="/training">Training</a>
      </div>
    </mat-toolbar>
    <!--
    The sidenav directive has a toggle method which we can trigger with a button using a local reference on the side
    nav.
    -->
    <!--<button (click)="sidenav.toggle()">Show Sidenav</button>-->
    <!-- <main> is added here just for semantic reasons -->
    <main>
      <router-outlet></router-outlet>
    </main>
  </mat-sidenav-content>
</mat-sidenav-container>
