<!--
For every Angular Material design component we want to use, we have to import a module.
-->
<!--
To use an icon in a button, we use the mat-icon-button selector, as shown below
-->
<button mat-icon-button color="accent">
  <!--
  To add an icon, we use the mat-icon selector along with the name of the icon inside the selectors.
  If the icon name has a space, we replace the space with an underscore.
  -->
  <mat-icon>home</mat-icon>
</button>
